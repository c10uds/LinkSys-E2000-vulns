# LinkSys-E2000 Vulnerabilities  

## Overview  
I have discovered multiple command injection vulnerabilities in the LinkSys E2000 device. These vulnerabilities exist across different functional modules, each corresponding to specific parameter input points.  

## Verification Environment  
All vulnerabilities were validated in a simulated environment using FirmAE, an advanced firmware emulation framework that enables dynamic analysis of IoT devices. This ensures the reproducibility of our findings under controlled conditions.  

## Vulnerability Details  
I have organized detailed analysis reports for each vulnerability in separate folders:  
- Each folder is named after the vulnerable parameter  
- Each folder contains a complete analysis of the command injection vulnerability for that specific parameter  

## Usage Instructions  
Researchers can examine the folder corresponding to each parameter name to access detailed information about a specific vulnerability. These reports aim to assist device manufacturers in patching the vulnerabilities while helping the security community understand the patterns and defenses against such vulnerabilities.
